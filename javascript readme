1)What is the diff b/w map and forEach?
    ans)->both are array functions  to loop through the  array items
    1)map in result rens a new array but for Each doesn't return anything in turn  modifies the original array
    2)we can chain things on map like(map()=>{}.filter())...
     but as forEach doesn't return any thing we can't  chain other methods

2)Diff b/w null and undefined?
    null is the actual value but undefined is the variable which is declared but not initialized

    type of null-object typeof undefined -undefined
    console.log(null==undefined)  ===>true
console.log(null===undefined)    ===>false

3)EventDelegation
    without adding event to each list item we add it to the parent add we'll use it to the childrens

4)Var , let , const diff
 ans)=>1)scope   var(function scope or global) let,const(block)
       2)declaration  var can be re declared but let and consts are not
